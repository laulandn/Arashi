The source code in this archive works with Think C 5.04. I still haven't updgraded to the latest version of the compiler, because I find that 5.04 is reliable and fast and works in a relatively small amount of memory. Version 8.0 is available and it's only a matter of time when I will have to move onto the new version. Universal headers will probably require some changes, but it should all be pretty easy.Good luck,           Juri MunkkiP.S. Recently updated for Think C 7
