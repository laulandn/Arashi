Arashi
======

Arashi is a Tempest game clone for Mac OS classic (68k and PPC).

Initially released in 1992 by Juri Munkki, it was then improved by several people.
Unfortunately, Mac OS classic computers are not easy to come by anymore.

The non-commercial/shareware licence you can find inside the source tree doesn't hold anymore, and
the code is now MIT Licenced.
